{{< figure align="center" src="/media/images/2015/03/ontological_argument.png" alt="Ontological Argument" caption="Hover Text: A God who holds the world record for eating the most skateboards is greater than a God who does not hold that record." >}}

Brief Explanation: The ontological argument is an argument is a type of argument used by theologians and philosophers try to prove the existence of god.

Megan and the guy with the round head are walking along presumably discussing the Ontological Argument and Megan says, "...but wouldn't a god who could find a flaw in the ontological argument be even greater?"

This is similar to the liar paradox. ("I am a liar.")

Shows the fundamental Problem with arguments about religion.

Why do people spend so much time on proofs like this?
