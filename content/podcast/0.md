Hey everyone, this is Del Putnam at the xkcd club podcast. We're still getting things set up here, but I wanted to let you know what this is all about.

It's a weekly discussion sparked by Randall Munroe's [xkcd web comic](http://xkcd.com/). The conversation might wander from philosophy to science to politics and pretty much anything else including why squirrels are such a great  symbol for the loveable idiot archetype.

So if you're a fan of xkcd, or even if you're not, but you think you might enjoy listening to me mispronounce words like archetype, Mydrane, or [malamanteau](https://xkcd.com/739/); then go ahead and [subscribe to the podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/xkcdclub) right now.  That way, when the first episode is available, it'll be a surprise treat like that pizza flavored combo you found between the sofa cushions when you were so hungry, but didn't want to get up and get a snack because you were binge watching game of thrones and even though you really had to pee, you decided to hold it through just one more episode.

Like I said, we're still setting things up, adjusting the knobs, and tweaking the fiddly bits. (Wow, that sounds a lot dirtier than I thought it would.) Anyway, go ahead and follow us on twitter at [@xkcdclub](https://twitter.com) and we'll let you know how things are going.  

Also, just a quick note of clarification. The xkcd club is not affiliated in any way with xkcd.com or Randall Munroe. We're just fans who like the comic or at least enjoy discussing it. The views and opinions expressed here are our own and it's highly unlikely they are shared by Randall, Megan, beret-guy or any other persons --- actual, fictional or simulated.

Thanks for checking us out and I hope you'll keep listening.
